# Capstone-Project---Nozomu---2020264

The main goal of the project is to evaluate hybrid against stand-alone time-series models using stock market data (S&P500 index).
Handling raw data from an open source library, Yahoo Finance, the data will be manipulated in order to apply forecasting models and having their performance compared using accuracy metrics. 

Focusing on better organization of the Capstone, the work will be composed by different Jupyters: 

- S&P500 - TS Analysis: Notebook composed by the data preparation, EDA and time-series analysis;
  
Due to non-stationarity encountered in the previous analysis, different approaches will be tested to check which one will yield the best option for this "problem".

- Log Returns: First technique to be applied to make the series stationary. 
  
- Seasonal Differencing: Second approach to be tested to make the data stationary.
